# PyLadies Assets

This repository is for all assets, logos, etc used for PyLadies.  Please read our full [Trademark Usage Policy][0]

PyLadies and the PyLadies logo are trademarks of the [Python Software Foundation][1].

In general, we want the logo to be used as widely as possible to indicate the support of or involvement with PyLadies. If you are a local PyLadies leader, you are free to adapt the logo to your location.  However, non-leaders, please [ask][2] first when using a derived version of the logo or when in doubt.


The PyLadies Logo
-----------------

The standard PyLadies wordmark logo (cursive writing) can be found in the [wordmark][4] directory of this repository.  Use in combination with the PyLadies Geek logo (below) is permitted. You may alter the colors of the wordmark but not the size or proportions.

The PyLady Geek Logo
----------------------

The PyLady Geek logo can be found in the [geek][5] directory of this repository.  Use in combination with the PyLadies wordmark logo is permitted.  You may alter the colors of the PyLady geek but not the size or proportions.


T-Shirts & Other Merchandise
----------------------------

PyLadies T-Shirts and other merchandise featuring the Python logo can be purchased at Cafepress (sales benefit the PyLadies organization). Making your own shirts is OK too, but please seek permission from the `PyLadies leadership <ask>`_ if you are planning to sell merchandise that shows the PyLadies logo.


Derivitive Work
---------------

If you are a local PyLadies leader, you are free to adapt the logo to your location.  Some examples can be found on our [locations page][3] as well as in the [locations][6] directory.
